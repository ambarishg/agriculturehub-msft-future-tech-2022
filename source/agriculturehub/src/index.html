      <h2>Paddy Disease Detection</h2>
      <p>Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the staple foods worldwide.

        Paddy, the raw grain before removal of husk, is cultivated in tropical climates,
         mainly in Asian countries. Paddy cultivation requires consistent supervision 
         because several diseases and pests might affect the paddy crops, 
         leading to up to 70% yield loss. 
         Expert supervision is usually necessary to mitigate these diseases and 
         prevent crop loss. With the limited availability of crop protection experts,
          manual disease diagnosis is tedious and expensive. 
          Thus, it is increasingly important to automate the disease identification 
          rocess by leveraging computer vision-based techniques that achieved 
          promising results in various domains. </p>

      <h2>Cassava Disease Detection</h2>
      <p>Cassava is a rich, affordable source of carbohydrates. It can provide more calories per acre of the
        crop than cereal grain crops, which makes it a very useful crop in developing nations.
        As the 2nd largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown
        by small-holder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of small-holder
        farmer households in Sub-Saharan Africa grow cassava and viral diseases are major sources of poor
        yields. 
      
        The Cassava Leaf Disease detection system would help the farmers to detect the
        disease correctly and take preventive measures for the same

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2>Bees Disease Detection</h2>
      <p>Every third bite of food relies on pollination by bees. Honey beehive losses are quite prevalent due to the diseased bees.

        While many indications of hive strength and health are visible on the inside of the hive, frequent check-ups on the hive are time-consuming and disruptive to the bees' workflow and hive in general. By investigating the bees that leave the hive, we can gain a more complete understanding of the hive itself. For example, an unhealthy hive infected with varroa mites will have bees with deformed wings or mites on their backs. These characteristics can be observed without opening the hive.
        
        We aim to detect healthy and various types of diseased bees such as bees having ant problems and varro and hive beetles</p>
