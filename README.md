**Paddy Disease Detection**

<hr/>

**Rice (Oryza sativa)** is one of the staple foods worldwide.    

Paddy, the raw grain before removal of husk, is cultivated in tropical climates, mainly in Asian countries. Paddy cultivation requires consistent supervision because several diseases and pests might affect the paddy crops, leading to up to 70% yield loss. Expert supervision is usually necessary to mitigate these diseases and prevent crop loss. With the limited availability of crop protection experts, manual disease diagnosis is tedious and expensive. Thus, it is increasingly **important to automate the disease identification process by leveraging computer vision-based techniques** that achieved promising results in various domains.
