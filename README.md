# Agriculture Hub                

The vision of **Agriculture Hub**  is to be a 1 stop destination for farmers across India to help them to cultivate better crops , fruits and also to better of their lives.    

In the present solution we have presented **4** components 

1. Static website which links the following 3 components   
2. **Paddy Disease Detection** -  For detecting Paddy Diseases   
3. **Cassava Disease Detection** -  For detecting Cassava Diseases   
4. **Bees Disease Detection** -  For detecting Bees Diseases

**Paddy Disease Detection**

<hr/>

**Rice (Oryza sativa)** is one of the staple foods worldwide.    

Paddy, the raw grain before removal of husk, is cultivated in tropical climates, mainly in Asian countries. Paddy cultivation requires consistent supervision because several diseases and pests might affect the paddy crops, leading to up to 70% yield loss. Expert supervision is usually necessary to mitigate these diseases and prevent crop loss. With the limited availability of crop protection experts, manual disease diagnosis is tedious and expensive. Thus, it is increasingly **important to automate the disease identification process by leveraging computer vision-based techniques** that achieved promising results in various domains.

**Cassava Disease Detection**

<hr/>

**Cassava** is a rich, affordable source of carbohydrates. It can provide more calories per acre of the
crop than cereal grain crops, which makes it a very useful crop in developing nations.             

As the 2nd largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown
by small-holder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of small-holder
farmer households in Sub-Saharan Africa grow cassava and viral diseases are major sources of poor
yields.             
We have taken 105 images for 5 categories,4 leaf disease categories[cbb,cbsd,cgm,cmd] and a
healthy category. The Cassava Leaf Disease detection system would help the farmers to detect the
disease correctly and take preventive measures for the same.
